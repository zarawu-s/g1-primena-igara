G-1 Primena igara za ucenje koncepata iz oblasti racunarstva

Prikazati principe primene igara za ucenje (Game based learning). Dati sistematican pregled stanja u literaturi i industriji u pogledu igara za pomoc ucenju koncepata iz oblasti racunarstva. 
• F1: Inicijalni skup izvora; identifikacija kategorija; draft rada. 
• F2: Sistematizacija rezultata; konacan oblik rada
Sa najmanje 30 izvora.
Polazna osnova: Pretraga literature "game based learning" "computer science" "programming"
Beleške sa casa „Prezentacija tema“: 
- primena igara ali striktno u oblasti racunarstva
- koju ulogu mogu da igraju igre u oblasti racunarstva
- izvora je puno, pa je cilj dati sistematican pregled, dakle ne samo spisak, vec i da se kategorizuju
Pitanja za kick-off: 
•	Da li da obratimo pažnju i na igre koje pomažu deci u upoznavanju sa konceptima iz oblasti racunarstva (uzrast: osnovna škola) ili samo na one koje pomažu ucenicima srednjih škola i studentima?
•	Da li su u temu ukljucene i igre koje služe kao pomoc ucenju nekog konkretnog programskog jezika ili samo koncepata?
•	...

[Various block-based programming languages, which are also accessible online (Scratch, Snap, Blockly), are used to develop students' computational thinking and block-based programming skills, especially in primary education. In addition, they support the development of interactive projects that students can use afterward. Moreover, students can develop animations, interactive stories, and games, which allow them to engage in the coding process, learn programming concepts and even learn about other computer science topics during game design.
Topics connected with programming are the most common in computer science, but learning how to program is often recognized as a frustrating activity. Learning object-oriented programming languages is especially difficult for students, because programming concepts are complex, cognitively demanding, require algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills, and is a long-term process. Game-based learning stimulates active learning and enables students to learn about programming concepts in fun and engaging ways through visual interfaces and engaging environments (CodeCombat, Alice, Greenfoot). Those engaging and motivating environments enable simplifying complex programming concepts, such as inheritance, nested loops, and recursion.
Different pedagogical strategies can be used to implement game-based learning in computer science, empowering students' skills and increasing their active engagement in learning. For example, students can deepen their knowledge and skills on a given topic by playing the game or through the process of game design. In both cases, the game-based approach can increase students' motivation and engagement in learning.]
